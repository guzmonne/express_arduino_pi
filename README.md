Introduction
------------

Project Repo of the *Express Arduino Pi* project for the course "Intelligent Embedded Systems" taken at the "University of Helsinki".

The idea behind the project was to be able to control different electric circuits built using Arduino through a web application running on a Raspberry Pi. It uses Node.JS to power the web server, Backbone.JS for the client-side code, Redis to store data, and INO to configure the Arduino boards.

Features
--------

- Controlling a multicolout LED.
- Register button presses on the client and storing the event.
- Mesauring and displaying room temperature.
- Measuring and displaying room humidity.
- Displaying messages on a 16x2 LCD display.
- Controll a basic servo.
